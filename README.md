# DevMind 🧠

> The quiz content is currently available in **German**, as it is tailored to the German FIAE curriculum (AP1).

DevMind is a web-based quiz application designed to support
**Fachinformatiker:innen – Anwendungsentwicklung (FIAE)**
in preparing for **AP1-related exams**.

The app focuses on **active knowledge recall** instead of passive learning
and helps users quickly identify real knowledge gaps.

## Motivation

During my retraining as an application developer, I noticed that
traditional learning methods (reading scripts, watching videos)
often create a false sense of confidence.

DevMind was created to provide a **practical, exam-oriented and time-efficient**
way to test knowledge — in small, focused units that can be completed
even during short study sessions.
